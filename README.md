# ITCS414 - Project 1 - YouGle: Your First Search Engine
A student project. Mahidol University, Faculty of ICT: `ITCS414 â€“ Information Storage and Retrieval`. 2019

This is a simple Implementation for a Search Engine. 

A simple indexing and retrieval system for a search engine. More specifically, it involves the Implementation a simple indexer that builds an uncompressed index over a corpus, and implement
retrieval for Boolean conjunctive queries.

Furthermore, the implementation of TF-IDF Weight with Cosine Similarity is also implemented in this project.
